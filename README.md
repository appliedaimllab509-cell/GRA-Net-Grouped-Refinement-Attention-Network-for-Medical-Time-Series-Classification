# GRA-Net-Grouped-Refinement-Attention-Network-for-Medical-Time-Series-Classification

## Abstract
 Accurate classification of medical time series (MeDTS) is essential for reliable clinical diagnosis but remains challenging due to complex multi-channel temporal dependencies, redundant information, and limited labeled data. While transformer-based models excel in time series analysis, most are designed for forecasting and fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of MeDTS. We propose GRA-Net **G**rouped **R**efinement **A**ttention **Net**), which captures both local and global temporal patterns while adaptively attending to critical channels and time steps. The model leverages multi-scale and dilated depthwise separable convolutions within a hierarchical attention framework, implemented via the Refined Context Attention block, to extract informative spatial and channel-wise features. A divide-and-group strategy applies attention over smaller token groups, which are further refined through learnable attention and residual connections, enabling efficient modeling. Experimental results show that GRA-Net enhances feature representations, suppresses noise, and consistently improves classification performance across diverse medical time series datasets.
